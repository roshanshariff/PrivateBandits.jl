We design algorithms that are i) differentially private, and ii) have regret guarantees that (almost) match the regret guarantees for the best non-private algorithms (e.g., upper confidence bound sampling and Thompson sampling). Moreover, through our experiments, we empirically show the effectiveness of our algorithms.},

  abstract = {We present differentially private algorithms for the stochastic Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) problem. This is a problem for applications such as adaptive clinical trials, experiment design, and user-targeted advertising where private information is connected to individual rewards. Our major contribution is to show that there exist \$($\backslash$epsilon, $\backslash$delta)\$ differentially private variants of Upper Confidence Bound algorithms which have optimal regret, \$O($\backslash$epsilon\^\{-1\} + $\backslash$log T)\$. This is a significant improvement over previous results, which only achieve poly-log regret \$O($\backslash$epsilon\^\{-2\} $\backslash$log\^\{2\} T)\$, because of our use of a novel interval-based mechanism. We also substantially improve the bounds of previous family of algorithms which use a continual release mechanism. Experiments clearly validate our theoretical bounds.},

  abstract = {We study the problem of estimating finite sample confidence intervals of the mean of a normal population under the constraint of differential privacy. We consider both the known and unknown variance cases and construct differentially private algorithms to estimate confidence intervals. Crucially, our algorithms guarantee a finite sample coverage, as opposed to an asymptotic coverage. Unlike most previous differentially private algorithms, we do not require the domain of the samples to be bounded. We also prove lower bounds on the expected size of any differentially private confidence set showing that our the parameters are optimal up to polylogarithmic factors.},

  abstract = {We study the problem of privacy-preserving collaborative filtering where the objective is to reconstruct the entire users-items preference matrix using a few observed preferences of users for some of the items. Furthermore, the collaborative filtering algorithm should reconstruct the preference matrix while preserving the privacy of each user. We study this problem in the setting of joint differential privacy where each user computes her own preferences for all the items, without violating privacy of other users' preferences. We provide the first provably differentially private algorithm with formal utility guarantees for this problem. Our algorithm is based on the Frank-Wolfe (FW) method, and consistently estimates the underlying preference matrix as long as the number of users \$m\$ is \$$\backslash$omega(n\^\{5/4\})\$, where \$n\$ is the number of items, and each user provides her preference for at least \$$\backslash$sqrt\{n\}\$ randomly selected items. We also empirically evaluate our FW-based algorithm on a suite of datasets, and show that our method provides nearly same accuracy as the state-of-the-art non-private algorithm, and outperforms the state-of-the-art private algorithm by as much as 30\%.},
